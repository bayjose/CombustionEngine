Welcome to Umori
You are a member of the Avarii Mining Corperation
You have worked for the Avarii Corperation for 12 years, and were abruptly transferred
by your superior with no information on where you were going. 
 
You think to yourself that this seems pretty suspicious, but the Avarii have
been a well trusted Cooperation since its formation, back when they were
mining Hydrogen3 on the moon in 2136,
 
So,
You go along with it, its not as if you have a choice though. 
 
Go over to the Matter-Replicator, something has printed for you.
